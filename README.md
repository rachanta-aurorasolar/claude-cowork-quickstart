# Claude Cowork: Unified Agentic Tooling

A high-performance library of skills and workflows for agentic coding assistants.. This repository merges the best of **Claude Code Quickstart** and **Superpowers** into a single, unified framework.

## Core Features

- **Standardized Workflows**: Consistent slash commands for `/brainstorm`, `/design`, `/implement`, `/connect`, and `/closeout`.
- **TDD-First Culture**: Built-in enforcement of Test-Driven Development as a non-negotiable standard.
- **Audience-Centric UI**: Flexible design systems (shadcn, Mantine) driven by deep audience research.
- **Agentic Traceability**: Structured observability and logging for complex multi-agent workflows.
- **Systematic Debugging**: Root cause analysis and verification principles.
- **Git Isolation**: Smart use of git worktrees to prevent workspace pollution.
- **Global Integrations**: Connect to 1000+ apps via Composio.
- **Persistent History**: Automated session tracking in `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` and automated changelogs.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Manual**: Start with [CLAUDE.md](file:///CLAUDE.md) to understand the operating standards.
2. **Review your History**: Check [PROJECT_HISTORY.md](file:///PROJECT_HISTORY.md) for the latest project context.
3. **Use the Skills**: Explore the [skills/](file:///skills/) directory for atomic "how-to" guides.

## Repository Structure

- `.agent/workflows/`: Unified slash command definitions.
- `skills/`: Atomic reference guides for specific techniques.
- `docs/plans/`: Storage for designs and implementation plans.
- `tests/`: Extensive test suites for verifying agent behavior.

## Workflows

Trigger workflows directly using slash commands in your agentic IDE:

### Core Development Cycle
- `/brainstorm`: Refine an idea into a design with audience research
- `/design`: Create a TDD implementation plan with architectural rigor
- `/implement`: Execute a plan step-by-step with observability
- `/code-review`: Perform a technical quality check and trace review
- `/closeout`: Apply Kaizen improvements, generate changelogs, and finalize history

### Utility Commands
- `/add-bug`: Add a bug to the tracking table without starting work on it
- `/add-feature`: Add a feature request to the implementation plan without starting work on it
- `/add-skills`: Scout and integrate patterns from new repositories
- `/connect`: Bridge to 1000+ external apps via Composio
